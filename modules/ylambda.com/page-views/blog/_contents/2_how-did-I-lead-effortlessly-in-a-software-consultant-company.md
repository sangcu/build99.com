In a technical leader role, itâ€™s common that you only allocate 10% to 20% of your efforts on leading, coaching (depending on the team size) and the remaining efforts could be used for other activities like development, technical consultant. 

Engineers are the busiest people, theyâ€™re all thinkers and distraction will impact productivity and me too, definitely.  Because I was too busy (I know, donâ€™t blame me for my time management skill ðŸ™‚) , authentic leaders usually focused on engineering work and forgot their leadership job until they had to do it (Ex: annual review, intermittent request).

However, as a leader, I was expected to help our people to succeed and to do that I need:  

* Understand how my members are doing?
* What are the best parts and bad parts of them?
* What are each of them motivated to do?
* Have a short feedback loop to understand situations (challenges, blocker, emotions) prior to it being too late.  

This is a time consuming task because it depends on many stakeholders and involves people (Project Manager, Quality Control, Other peers members) . I wonder if I can do it automation, of course, meeting with people face to face is inevitable but for most of the repetitive tasks, we can do it automatically.

## Building an automation tools and frameworks for leaders
### Plan ahead
For each member, to help them I would need to understand how they are doing in the current job. Is it fulfilling them? Is it a boring task and ask them about how they are expecting things?
So I have a meeting with my team and plan out a biweekly check to ask them a few open-ended questions. The system will send out questions form and record the result so I can review the feedback at any time, on the go. Alway keep in touch with our members.

### The art of open-ended questions
Have you ever asked questions which lead to your member only answers yes/no? And no more information has been collected to understand your member? I made the same mistake like that so asking the right questions is key. 

So what is the open-ended question? Here is the explanation  

> Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a longer response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.  

Here are a few notes when you create open ended questions:  
* What do you think about your learning development?
* Give an example of the hard core task you have done in the last month
* How do you solve conflict with your quality control team?
* What do you see as your improvement in the next 6 months?

Those questions will give you more information about your members so that you can understand and help them better.

When I was playing a leading role I didnâ€™t know anything about this kind of question, I just followed my gut feeling and had no idea about an approach to understanding my members. I believed a good software could help to provide suggestions for newbies and it's invaluable.

### Shorter feedback loop
Have you ever been in a situation where your member resigned without your awareness? Most of the issues come from the feedback loop being too long. Let me explain what it is.

In software development, we always want to keep the feedback shorter by implementing unit tests, functional testing and integrated into CI pipeline, itâ€™s called Shift-Left.  

In people development, we should do the same, the more feedback loop we have between leader and members the better. If your member is in a bad situation you will step in to help at the right time. By helping people, we are building great team performance and resilience.

Keeping the feedback loop shorter could be manual work like scheduling meetings with your member or using chat tools, however itâ€™s not working well in remote environments where most of the work and communication is asynchronous. We need to use a tool to help to minimize the efforts for review/feedback and it should automatically.

## Conclusion
People development is incredibly hard work. As a leader we have to spend a lot of effort on this topic to help our members, and automation tools could help us on this topic and make life better for us.
