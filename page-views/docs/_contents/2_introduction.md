# A journey on simplifying ops for software engineers to focus on writing high-quality software.  

> yLambda is a platform engineering that provides engineers a self-service to deploy, and observability the application.  

Developers who write the high quality code understand that it takes time to reiterate the code to get a good shape of structure, cohesive, modular and generalised.  

In reality, coding is just a part of their work because they have to take care of CI/CD pipelines, operate the application, tracing issues and its non-trivial task.

## The pain points

Most of the time, monitoring and understand what went wrong is not easy task as they have to setup a complex harmony stacks in the cloud or if they’re using kubernetes then they have to learn a lot to manage the infrastructure platform and get them away from where they do the best; writing high-quality code and shipping feature to bring value to business.  

Getting developers out of design and writing software will impact software delivery in both short and long term. So what would we do differently?

yLambda comes into play, we will automatically set up the whole opinionated stack on top of your kubernetes and provide the interface for developers to self-service to build and deploy, monitoring, tracing in minutes.
## Going succeed together
When integrated with yLambda, developers now can experiment with ideas by up and running applications in minutes and get rid of the burden of deployment, tracing; only focus on designing high quality software and just deploy it.  

Don’t waste your developer time as it's too expensive. Let's get started with yLambda.
