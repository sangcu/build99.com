## Simplicity

> The quality of being easy to understand or use.

This is why we have started yLambda, to embrace DevOps culture and provide a simplified tooling for developers. Any decisions should be considered user experience with this in mind.


## Securability

> The characteristic of being securable

In the growing complexity of the system, a secure platform is a top priority to protect our customers from potential threats.


## Extensibility
> The ability to be extended or stretched

There is no all-in-one in DevOps, each customer has different use cases and yLambda have the ability to extend to meet the new requirements of the business.

## Adaptability
> The quality of being able to adjust to new conditions

Hosting in the cloud, and on-premise should not be a limitation of yLambda. Also, different customer has security concerns at different level so we have to take this into account to design a system.
