Doing performance review is key to promote or increase salary for engineers. One of the challenges when playing a role as leader in a software development team is performance review for every team member. Doing it wrong will make engineers resign, it’s even bad for the leader’s personal brand. Here are a few wrong things that we can observe.

## Performance Review's in wrong way
### No predefined goals
It’s uncommon for leaders and engineers to sit down together and define what it means to meet expectations, outstanding or excellence. Without this definition, all the rating at the end of the review period does not make sense and it’s about different people's opinions. Predefined goals are key to make engineers satisfied and getting agreement easier in the review period.

### No continuous feedback for quarterly, annual review.
During the review period, there is likely no leader’s feedback to engineers to help them do the right things and become high performance. One of the key reasons is that in the software industry we are always busy solving problems on a daily basis. Even the feedback only takes a few minutes but we as engineers do not put our mind in that topic much so we need a better way to do this feedback in an automated way.

### Leader based on specific event to make decisions
Without any empirical evidence and historical data, as a human being, we only remember subjective events. The performance review is a matter of opinions in which different people will have different views and this is also the reason to make engineers not happy with the performance result or even in the worst case, they don’t care about it anymore and are preparing for a job move.
